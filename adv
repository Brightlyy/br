Sure, here are some search tricks you can use to enhance your search queries::

    Quotation Marks: Use quotation marks to search for an exact phrase. For example, "machine learning" will only return results where these two words appear together in this order.

    Minus Sign (-): Exclude specific terms from your search by using the minus sign. For example, "python -snake" will return results related to Python programming but exclude those about snakes.

    Site Search: Use the site: operator to search within a specific website or domain. For example, "site:wikipedia.org Python" will search for Python-related pages only on Wikipedia.

    Wildcard (*): Use the asterisk as a placeholder for unknown words or characters. For example, "artificial * research" will return results like "artificial intelligence research" or "artificial neural network research."

    File Type: Use the filetype: operator to search for specific file types. For example, "machine learning filetype:pdf" will return PDF files related to machine learning.

    Related Search: Use the related: operator to find sites similar to a specific website. For example, "related:stackoverflow.com" will return sites similar to Stack Overflow.

    Range Search: Use two periods (..) to specify a range. For example, "Python 3..5" will return results related to Python versions 3, 4, and 5.

    Define: Use the define: operator to get definitions of a specific term. For example, "define:algorithm" will return definitions of the word "algorithm."

    Calculator: You can perform calculations directly in the search bar. For example, typing "5 * 5" will return the result "25."

    Weather: You can check the weather by typing "weather" followed by a location. For example, "weather New York" will show the current weather in New York City.

These are just a few tricks you can use to improve your search queries and find more relevant information efficiently.
